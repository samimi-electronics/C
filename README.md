# My C programs repo
In this repo you will find all the code featured on my Instagram page and my online/offline lectures.
## How to use
All the programs were written on Ubuntu 18.04 and compiled using gcc. You can run the programs using the ./program_name command on your terminal. if you want to run the programs on any other platform other that linux, you should compile the source files yourself.
